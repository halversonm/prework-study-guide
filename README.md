# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

As a new bootcamp student, the building of this prework study guide allowed me to learn about topics including HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. It also allows me to document notes on these topics that I can review at any time.
